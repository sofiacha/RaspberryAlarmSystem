This repository created to save the projects I created following this tutorial:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR5h0UnMcUE&list=PLFA4eZ_bEubl_zVY-Dikk7Rpttk2xeWFv">RaspberryPiIVBeginners</a>
As I continued, I got interesting in creating a simple alarm system using RaspberryPi. The project that I created for this reason is senso.py .
All The other files are code from the tutorial and some of them from other tutorials, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kpGcMjpDcw">Send email from a Python script on the Raspberry Pi</a>
