# RaspberryAlarmSystem
This repository created to save the projects I created following this tutorial:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR5h0UnMcUE&list=PLFA4eZ_bEubl_zVY-Dikk7Rpttk2xeWFv">RaspberryPiIVBeginners</a>
As I continued, I got interested in creating a simple alarm system using RaspberryPi. The project that I created for this reason is senso.py .
All The other files are code from the tutorial and some of them from other tutorials, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kpGcMjpDcw">Send email from a Python script on the Raspberry Pi</a>
For this project I used a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">RaspberryPi v3</a> and the <a href="https://grobotronics.com/raspberry-pi-youtube-workshop-kit.html">Raspberry Pi YouTube Workshop Kit</a> in which included:
<ul>
 <li>1 x Transparent Half-Size Breadboard</li>
 <li>15 x Male to Female Jumper Wires</li>
 <li>5 x Male to Male Jumper Wires</li>
 <li>1 x Ultra Bright 5mm Red LED</li>
 <li>1 x Ultra Bright 5mm Blue LED</li>
 <li>2 x 330Ω Resistor</li>
 <li>2 x 4.7kΩ Resistor</li>
 <li>1 x 1µF Capacitor</li>
 <li>1 x PCB Mount Push Button</li>
 <li>1 x PCB Mount Buzzer</li>
 <li>1 x DS18B20+ Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer</li>
 <li>1 x Light Dependent Resistor</li>
 <li>1 x HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor</li>
</ul>

Also a database, a website and an android application would be created and uploaded!
